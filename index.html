    <p class="info_text">My first interaction with technology would be the commodore 64 my family got when I was just four years old. I was interested in how the machine worked and played games on it like, Where in the World is Carmen San Diego. Personal computers had caught on by the time I was getting my bachelor's degree from San Francisco State University and I used an orange mac book to complete my assignments. </p> <p class="info_text"> After college I taught myself how to program and record <a href="http://www.melissastmoore.com">music</a> on a Triton Korg with a floppy disc drive. I became interested in Graphic Design after creating websites to promote the music I wrote. While pursuing career in music including playing shows in LA and New York, I worked as an Executive Assistant in the high tech, aerospace industry. There I created processes for inventory management, created templates in Corel Draw, helped trouble shoot IT issues, interfaced with vendors and clients, and was the hub of the office. I was the assistant to the CEO Kumar Patel, the inventor of the C02 laser. After working there for four years, I decided it was time to record and produce an album of original electronic music. After putting the album out and working in other part time office jobs in tech, I decided to learn how to code because I was burnt out from office work, and need a career that is creatively fulfilling while continuing to make music and play shows. </p>
    <p class="info_text"> I've created websites using CSS, HTML, JS, and Wordpress. I've studied web development on my own and in college courses. I enjoy performing music, listening to bands, biking, technology, writing, art, people watching, and spending time with my husband and two dogs, Akira and Lou. </p>
